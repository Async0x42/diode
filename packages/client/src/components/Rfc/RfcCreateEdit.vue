                    The RFC has been validated and is ready for Impact Assessment (IA). The Change Agent will request IA from designated individuals
                    and organizations, within a predetermined timeframe. When all IAs have been returned and assessed, the Change Agent will determine
                    the feasibility to approve the RFC or pursue otherwise.

                    Not Approved:
                    <br />
                    Upon completion of assessing the Impact Analyses gathered, the Change Agent has determined that the RFC has been rejected for
                    business, technical or operational reasons.

                    <br />
                    A RFC may be deferred if the Change Agent deems that circumstances surrounding the change do not warrant further consideration of
                    the RFC at this time. Although Deferred RFCs are placed temporarily outside of the Change Management process, this does not
                    preclude the Change Initiator from continuing work on the RFC to address the issues that led to its deferral. All Deferred RFCs
                    will be annotated with a Bring Forward Date, at which time they will re-enter the Change Management process at the Change Agent

                    <br />
                    The Change Authority assigns A status of Cancelled to an RFC when circumstances warrant the cessation of further staffing or
                    implementation of the proposed change. A RFC must be cancelled when the proposed change cannot be implemented as originally

                    These descriptions are guidelines and are not absolute. The overriding consideration should be the measurable impact on related

                    Draft:
                    <br />
                    When a new RFC is initiated, itâ€™s classification is defaulted to RFCs. A draft RFC implies that it is still being worked on and as
                    a result, is not yet viewable by other users. Once the Local Authority (LA) has reviewed the RFC, they will assign its class as
                    Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3 based on the potential impact as defined below. During processing, the Classification of a Change may
                    be amended to a more appropriate level should it be determined that the Change needs to be escalated or de-escalated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Class 1:
                    <br />
                    A Change that has Departmental level impact such as an impact on common Information Management (IM) services (as defined in IMD
                    100) or standards, IM policies, or that impacts more than one Environmental Command or Group Principle (EC/GP). This class of
                    change includes the modification of Configuration Items (CIs) used by more than one specific user community (EC/GP) nationally.
                    The Information Management Configuration Control Board (IM CCB) approves all Class 1 Changes. For an Immediate Class 1 change,
                    impact assessments must be submitted within 24 hours of the RFC being opened for Impact Assessment. Routine Class 1 impact
                    assessments have a submission deadline of 10 business days.

                    Class 2:
                    <br />
                    A change that impacts functional IM Services (as defined in IMD 100) but does not have an impact on common IM services and
                    standards. Class 2 changes only affect Configuration Items (CIs) solely within a specific user community (EC/GP). For Class 2
                    impact assessment turnaround times please consult the appropriate Change Management Agent (CMA). The appropriate EC/GP CCB or CMA
                    shall approve class 2 changes.

                  <p>
                    Class 3:
                    <br />
                    A change that impacts the Local (delegated authority) level (Base, Wing, Formation or Units) but does not impact common or
                    functional IM services or standards. This change only affects Configuration Items (CIs) that are used by a subset of users of a
                    specific user community (EC/GP). Class 3 changes only affect CIs solely within a specific user community (EC/GP). For Class 3
                    impact assessment turnaround times please consult the appropriate Local Authority (LA). The appropriate Base/Wing/Formation CCB or
                    LA is responsible for approving Class 3 changes.
