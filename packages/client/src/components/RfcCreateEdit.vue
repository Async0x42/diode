                  These descriptions are guidelines and are not absolute. The overriding consideration should be the measurable impact on related
                  Configuration Items (CIs) and organizations.

                  Draft:
                  <br />
                  When a new RFC is initiated, itâ€™s classification is defaulted to RFCs. A draft RFC implies that it is still being worked on and as a
                  result, is not yet viewable by other users. Once the Local Authority (LA) has reviewed the RFC, they will assign its class as Class
                  1, Class 2 or Class 3 based on the potential impact as defined below. During processing, the Classification of a Change may be
                  amended to a more appropriate level should it be determined that the Change needs to be escalated or de-escalated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Class 1:
                  <br />
                  A Change that has Departmental level impact such as an impact on common Information Management (IM) services (as defined in IMD 100)
                  or standards, IM policies, or that impacts more than one Environmental Command or Group Principle (EC/GP). This class of change
                  includes the modification of Configuration Items (CIs) used by more than one specific user community (EC/GP) nationally. The
                  Information Management Configuration Control Board (IM CCB) approves all Class 1 Changes. For an Immediate Class 1 change, impact
                  assessments must be submitted within 24 hours of the RFC being opened for Impact Assessment. Routine Class 1 impact assessments have
                  a submission deadline of 10 business days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Class 2:
                  <br />
                  A change that impacts functional IM Services (as defined in IMD 100) but does not have an impact on common IM services and
                  standards. Class 2 changes only affect Configuration Items (CIs) solely within a specific user community (EC/GP). For Class 2 impact
                  assessment turnaround times please consult the appropriate Change Management Agent (CMA). The appropriate EC/GP CCB or CMA shall
                  approve class 2 changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Class 3:
                  <br />
                  A change that impacts the Local (delegated authority) level (Base, Wing, Formation or Units) but does not impact common or
                  functional IM services or standards. This change only affects Configuration Items (CIs) that are used by a subset of users of a
                  specific user community (EC/GP). Class 3 changes only affect CIs solely within a specific user community (EC/GP). For Class 3 impact
                  assessment turnaround times please consult the appropriate Local Authority (LA). The appropriate Base/Wing/Formation CCB or LA is
                  responsible for approving Class 3 changes.

                  All network devices (such as servers, workstations and routers) are expected to conform to the DND Naming Standards Policy (IMS
                  6002-1-1).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The IMS 6002-1-1 Policy applies to all DND networks, both Designated and Classified. The detailed document can be found at:
                  http://img-ggi.mil.ca/pi-ip/dao-doa/index-eng.asp
                </p>

                <p>The IMS 6002-1-1 syntax is: [SupportUnit]hyphen[Location/Owner]hyphen[Function Code][Physical or Virtual][SequenceNumber]</p>

                <p>
                  For tracking purposes, it is requested that all network devices referenced in a RFC, appear in the Affected Configuration Items
                  section of the RFC.
